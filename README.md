# clion-makefile

Example of makefile usage in CLion.

This example has been tested on Windows 7 with MinGW which is why the custom command in CMakeLists.txt shows `mingw32-make`.

It allows you to build from the IDE and errors in the log window are clickable. However, hints in the editor ave very limited compared to CMake proejcts.
